# typewriter
A simple template for some cool looking text with a typewriter effect.

JS Code Used:
Credit: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typewriter-effect@2.18.2/

In the script.js file, I inserted the code from the above URL.
To change this, thereby giving the original owner more credit, replace the "/script.js" in the code line "<script src="/script.js"></script>" with "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typewriter-effect@2.18.2/dist/core.js".

Enjoy and if you have any questions reach out to me @ noir#0003 on discord.
